<h3>Welcome to my repo!</h3>

I am a skilled and passionate developer with expertise in building web applications using cutting-edge technologies. My website showcases my extensive resume and portfolio, highlighting my proficiency in Next.js with TypeScript and the latest Next.js version 13 app router.

As a developer, I have undertaken a significant project called "Bus Poribohon." This project offers a seamless and efficient bus ticketing system for users, covering 32 bus routes. To ensure the utmost security and privacy, I have implemented a robust authentication system that verifies users through email. Once verified, users gain access to our ticket purchase platform, where they can purchase up to 4 tickets per day.

I take pride in my attention to detail, and every successful ticket purchase triggers the automatic delivery of a visually appealing ticket information PDF directly to the user's email. Additionally, this information is accessible in the user's frontend dashboard, creating a streamlined and user-friendly experience.

My personal dashboard design is aesthetically pleasing and easy to navigate. Users can add buses to their favorites for convenient access and manage their account settings effortlessly. Furthermore, I have integrated Recharts for data visualization, enabling administrators to make data-driven decisions based on ticket purchase trends.

Through my personal website, I aim to display not only my technical skills but also my commitment to delivering user-centric and visually appealing solutions. I believe that my proficiency in Next.js, TypeScript, and data visualization tools like Recharts make me a valuable asset to any development team.

Thank you for visiting my website, and I hope you enjoy exploring my resume and portfolio. Feel free to reach out to me for any collaboration opportunities or to discuss exciting new projects!
